# TfL-Customer Satisfaction Survey Analysis (2011 Data)
An Overall CSAT is a favorable score of 77.94 because it exceeds the Expected CSAT score of 77.63
• CSAT Score demonstrates a good performance of CSAT 79.50 because it exceeds the set goal of CSAT 79 
• Customer Safety & Security and Information are favorably performing parameters because they exceed the Expected CSAT of 77.63, and Train Service, Cleanliness, and Staff Helpfulness & Availability are adversely performing variables because they score less than the Expected CSAT of 77.63
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 An importance-performance analysis shown in Figure 3 demonstrates how the three adverse performing agent parameters perform against the overall CSAT score. The diagonal line (iso-priority) line implies that performance equals importance and the points above it fail to meet the expected performance score and require management attention. Thus, the strategic analysis concludes as follows;
• Train service; Performance at Picadilly Line requires focus to improve the score, whereas Circle & Hammersmith and City and Metropolitan Lines require management attention but are low priority 
• Cleanliness; Performance at Bakerloo and Picadilly Lines require focus to improve the score, whereas the Central Line require management attention but are low priority 
• Staff Helpfulness and Availability; Bakerloo, Picadilly, and Northern Lines need management focus as they are a high priority to improve the score, whereas Victoria and District Lines require management attention but are low priority
